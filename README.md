# Mailing List 

This is an open sourced product that allows you to simply create a page capable of collecting user data for a mailing list. 

TODO: 

 - Replace with netlify function and use HTMX
 - Need to create netlify function to integrate with Google instead. I need to inject the script URL in an env variable for security and this can't be done in vanilla js. 
 - Need to create a template for the Google Sheet file. Anyone should be able to easily create this app.
